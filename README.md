# FreedomEcho

Public archive of our group’s announcements, rules, and transparency notes.  
This is a **static site** built with **Jekyll** and deployed via **GitHub Pages** to **https://gate2freedom.com**.

## Structure
- `/` – landing page and navigation
- `/announcements/` – chronological archive of announcements (from `_posts/`)
- `/rules/` – house rules and governance notes
- `/about/` – project background

## Publishing
Add a new Markdown file under `_posts/`:
`YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` with standard front matter (`title`, `date`, optional `tags`).  
Push to `main` → GitHub Actions builds and publishes automatically.

## License
- **Code & templates**: MIT License (see `LICENSE`)
- **Site content (texts)**: CC BY-NC 4.0 (see `CONTENT_LICENSE`)
